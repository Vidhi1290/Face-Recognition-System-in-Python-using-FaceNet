## Image Classification from Video using Computer Vision and Deep Learning ðŸ“¸ðŸ¤–

## Project Overview
Dive into the world of computer vision and artificial intelligence with our Image Classification from Video project! Leveraging advanced techniques like Haar Cascade Object Detection and pre-trained deep learning models, this project is designed to identify faces within images and videos. From downloading videos to training machine learning models, this project covers the entire spectrum of computer vision applications.

## Key Features
- **Video Processing:** Efficiently download and process videos using Python scripts.
- **Face Detection:** Utilize Haar Cascade Algorithm to extract faces from images and videos.
- **Deep Learning Magic:** Leverage pre-trained FaceNet models and VGGFace architecture for accurate face recognition.
- **Modular Approach:** Explore organized modular code, allowing seamless understanding and customization.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize embeddings and model predictions for deeper insights.
- **Google Colab Integration:** Benefit from the power of Google Colab for efficient model training.

## Data Description
